<h1>The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.</h1

<h2>Union Types (A | B)</h2>

<p>A union type allows a variable to hold multiple possible types. Itâ€™s represented using the pipe ( | ) symbol.</p>

<strong>Use Case:</strong> <p>When you want a variable or parameter to accept multiple types without restriction to just one specific structure.</p>
<pre>
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

function printValue(value: StringOrNumber) {
  console.log(value);
}

printValue(42); 
printValue("Hello");
</pre>

<h3>Significance of Union Types:</h3>

<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Allows a variable to accept multiple types, making the code more flexible and reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Type Narrowing:</strong> TypeScript can use narrowing techniques (like typeof or type guards) to determine the specific type within the union, allowing for safer operations on the variable.</li>

<h2>Intersection Types (A & B)</h2>

<p>An intersection type is the combination of multiple types into one. It's represented with the ampersand (&) symbol.</p>

<strong>Use Case:</strong><p> When you want a variable or parameter to require all properties from multiple types.</p>

<pre>
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee {
  employeeId: number;
}

type EmployeeProfile = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeProfile = {
  name: "Sopnil",
  age: 25,
  employeeId: 1234,
};
</pre>

<h3>Significance of Intersection Types:</h3>

<li><strong>Composition:</strong>Allows for composing multiple types into a new, more specific type, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures.</li>
<li><strong>Type Safety</strong>Ensures that any object of an intersection type has all required properties from each intersected type, reducing the chances of runtime errors.</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, these types enable TypeScript to be both flexible and strict, allowing for powerful type-check to complex data structures.</p>
